## Tips

- Different [classes](./classes) benefit from different [enchants](./enchants), on some they might be great and on others useless
- Upgrading enchanted equipment will be costly if you try to keep up with your level, don't use too many at once.
- Finding good chests can be a hustle, increasing quest levels will result in higher level chest (with few exceptions).
- Most equipment tiers can be found in any chest tier (with exceptions) with a very low chance (some rarer than others).

### Notes

- [Gargoyles](./mini-bosses#gargoyle) may hold any chest tier except for Pink Jewelled.
- Every [Multiplayer Dungeon](./quests#multiplayer-dungeons)  has it's own chance for a Pink Jewelled chest to appear.
