Chests can have different rarities. Better the rarity is, the better equipment it is.

## Equipment Tiers

### Wooden

Upgradeable. They have no enchants, unlike the enchanted counterparts; however, they are very common to get in wooden chests, and the maximum level is up to 100+ (the chest must be at that level). The chances for an enchanted weapon and **Unique** weapon to drop are quite rare.

### Silver

The equipment's maximum level is 49 from level 100+ silver chests. The chances to drop **Unique** equipment are rare. The enchants can be efficient, depending on the picked class.

### Golden

Unique equipment starts being more commonly found now. The higher the level of the chest, the better the stats of the equipment. There's a small chance for **Super Unique** or enchanted equipment to drop.

### Jewel

The higher the level of the chest, the better the stats of the equipment. Their maximum level is 52 from level 100+ jewel chests. There's a rare chance to get **Unique** or enchanted equipment.

### Pink Jewel

This chest always drops **Jeweled** equipment and has a rare chance to get **Unique** or enchanted equipment. The best equipment that can be dropped from these chests is **Ultimate** equipment. The higher the chest level, the more common it is to get the Ultimate equipment.

## Tips

- Dismantle wooden tier equipment. They aren't worth keeping.
- Don't dismantle enchanted equipment, as they might be useful later.
- **Super Unique** equipment can change your class, so choose carefully.
- Pink Jewel chests can be found in multiplayer dungeons (examples: Libera, Feisu).
