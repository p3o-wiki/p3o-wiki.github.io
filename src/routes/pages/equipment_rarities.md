# Equipment Rarities and Chests
Chests can have different rarities. Better the rarity is, the better equipment it is.
## Chest Tiers
- Wooden
- Silver
- Golden
- Jewel
- Pink Jewel
Pink Jeweled can be found in Multiplayer Dungeons (ex. Depths of Rage, Depths of Jealousy).
## Equipment Tiers
### Common
Upgradeable. They have no special properties. Maximum drop level is your current max level. Usually drops from Wooden chests.
### Enchanted
Upgradeable. Enchants will affect your stats Maximum drop level is up to half of your current max level (up to +50) but can be upgraded to +100. Usually drops from Silver chests.
### Unique
Not upgradeable. Every item has special stats that define it. Maximum level is 64% of your current max level (max. +64). Usually drops from Golden chests.
### Super Unique
Not upgradeable. Most likely stronger than Unique but not always, may affect your stats in a way you don't like. Maximum level is 52% of your current max level (max. +52). Usually drops from Jeweled and **Pink Jeweled** chests.
### Ultimate
Drops with very a low chance from **Pink Jeweled** chests, the higher the chest level the higher the chance! Will always be the best equipment.
### Relics
New items with special powers! Can be found at the end of some floors or quests. Can't be found in chests.
## Tips
- Common items will be your highest level equipment until you put in extra work, they'll also be your best source of ka-ching.
- Different classes benefit from different enchants, on some they might be great and on others useless
- Upgrading enchanted equipment will be costly if you try to keep up with your level, don't use too many at once.
- Finding good chests can be a hustle, increasing quest levels will result in higher level chest (with few exceptions).
- Most equipment tiers can be found in any chest tier (with exceptions) with a very low chance (some rarer than others).
### Notes
- Gargoyles may hold any chest tier except for Pink Jeweled.
- Every Multiplayer Dungeon has it's own chance for a Pink Jeweled chest to appear.
- Obtaining Unique and Super Unique items with levels higher than designed is possible but they're not permanent.
- Drop level may vary greatly.
## Tips
- Dismantle wooden tier equipment. They aren't worth keeping.
- Don't dismantle enchanted equipment, as they might be useful later.
- **Super Unique** equipment can change your class, so choose carefully.
- Pink Jewel chests can be found in multiplayer dungeons (examples: Libera, Feisu).
