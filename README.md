# Patapon 3 Overhaul Wiki

## Syntax

The syntax is the same as in Markdown, with inline HTML support.
Note that you need to have _headers_ describing the title, order (used to sort the articles), and the category (used to display in groups on the home page). This file won't be updated as the header requirement grows, so be sure to check under `src/routes/pages` for examples!
